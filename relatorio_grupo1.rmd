## Dataset Download and Import

This analysis is conducted in R using Bioconductor packages and other essential libraries for statistical and machine learning applications. 

In this section, we will perform the following tasks: install and load the required packages, query and download gene expression data using the GDC data portal, and import the data into a suitable structure for downstream analysis.

### Installation and Import of Packages

This section presents all the packages used in this work, which support data acquisition and analysis throughout the document, enhancing the efficiency of retrieving and interpreting relevant information. The code checks whether each package is already installed and installs it if necessary.

```{r, results='hide', warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Install BiocManager if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

# List of Bioconductor packages
bioc_packages <- c(
  "TCGAbiolinks",
  "DESeq2",
  "Biobase",
  "genefilter",
  "pheatmap",
  "org.Hs.eg.db",
  "fgsea",
  "SummarizedExperiment",
  "Glimma",
  "edgeR",
  "AnnotationDbi"
)

# Install missing Bioconductor packages
for (pkg in bioc_packages) {
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
    BiocManager::install(pkg, ask = FALSE)
  }
}

# List of CRAN packages
cran_packages <- c(
  "jpeg",
  "ggbeeswarm",
  "ggplot2",
  "xfun",
  "factoextra",
  "Rtsne",
  "gplots",
  "RColorBrewer",
  "tidyverse",
  "rpart",
  "rsample",
  "caret"
)

# Install missing CRAN packages
for (pkg in cran_packages) {
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
}

```

### Load Packages  

After installing the required packages, we need to load them into our R environment. The following command ensures all libraries are available for analysis:

```{r,results='hide', warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(BiocManager)
library(jpeg)
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(Biobase)
library(DESeq2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(genefilter)
library(pheatmap)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
library(fgsea)
library(ggplot2)
library(xfun)
library(SummarizedExperiment) 
library(factoextra)
library(Rtsne)
library(gplots)
library(edgeR)
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart)
library(rsample)
library(caret)
```

### Data Query and Preparation

The **`GDCquery()`** function is used to perform a query on the database. In this function, several parameters are defined to filter the dataset that will later be downloaded.

The **`project`** parameter corresponds to the ID assigned to the cancer type, allowing the selection of information specifically related to endometrial carcinoma of the uterine body. The **`data.category`** parameter is used to specify the data category to be selected. In this case, since the goal is to perform transcriptomic analysis, the category **"Transcriptome Profiling"** was selected to retrieve gene expression profiling data.

Among the available gene expression profiling data, the analysis was restricted to gene expression quantification by setting **`data.type`** to **"Gene Expression Quantification"**. Finally, the desired type of gene expression analysis was specified, opting for **"STAR-Counts"**. This workflow indicates that the algorithm used to count gene expression from aligned sequences was based on the **STAR** tool.

The **`GDCdownload()`** function is then used to download the data according to the query defined in the previous step. Next, the **`GDCprepare()`** function was used to generate a **`SummarizedExperiment`** object, compiling all the downloaded data into a single object to facilitate further analysis. It is worth noting that this function also allows saving the data in **.RData** format, making it easier to reload using the **`load()`** function.

> **Note**: This workflow enables the simultaneous download of both gene expression data and the associated metadata for the samples and genes.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Define the base directory

# base_dir <- "/Users/mariacarvalho/Desktop/Mestrado/2º\ semestre/Extração"  # Change this to your desired path
# base_dir <- "/home/arog/Documents/university/2_semestre/ECDB/project_data"
# base_dir <- "C:\\Users\\catar\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\extracao\\projeto_r\\dadossss"


# Create directory if it doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists(base_dir)) {
  dir.create(base_dir, recursive = TRUE)
}

# File path for storing processed data
gdc_data <- file.path(base_dir, "GDCdata")
rna_seq_file <- file.path(base_dir, "mRNA_TCGA-LUAD.rda")

# Check if the data file already exists, if not, download and process
if (!file.exists(rna_seq_file)) {

  query_LUAD <- GDCquery(
    project = "TCGA-LUAD",
    data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
    data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
    workflow.type = "STAR - Counts"
  )

  GDCdownload(query = query_LUAD, directory = gdc_data)

  rna_seq_LUAD <- GDCprepare(
    query = query_LUAD,
    save = TRUE,
    save.filename = rna_seq_file,
    directory = gdc_data
  )

} else {
  rna_seq_LUAD <- get(load(rna_seq_file))
  rm(data)
}

```


## Contextualization of the Data

The **TCGA-LUAD (The Cancer Genome Atlas - Lung Adenocarcinoma) project** is part of the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), aimed at characterizing lung adenocarcinoma at the molecular level. It provides **clinical, genomic, and molecular** data, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics, sequencing data, and protein expression profiles.

### Dataset Composition

The TCGA-LUAD collection encompasses **600 lung adenocarcinoma samples** with extensive molecular profiling. The transcriptomic data captures expression levels for approximately **60,000 genes**, providing unprecedented breadth in molecular characterization. Following rigorous quality control and preprocessing procedures, **27,326 genes** were retained for downstream analysis, ensuring both data quality and comprehensive coverage of the transcriptome.

### Research Focus

This study focuses on analyzing **data and metadata** to assess quality, completeness, and usability. By examining metadata, we evaluate its role in ensuring data consistency, accessibility, and interoperability for research applications.

### Objectives

This project aims to:
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LUAD
- Investigate associations between gene expression and clinical variables
- Discover biomarkers or gene signatures for prognosis or treatment

### Research Applications

The richness and scale of this dataset make it an invaluable resource for:
1. **Expression Profiling**: Mapping transcriptional activity across the genome in lung adenocarcinoma
2. **Molecular Subtyping**: Classifying tumors into distinct biological and clinical entities
3. **Pathway Analysis**: Investigating dysregulated biological pathways driving LUAD development
4. **Integrative Analysis**: Combining transcriptomic data with other molecular layers and clinical information

### Significance in Lung Cancer Research

The comprehensive nature of the TCGA-LUAD dataset supports efforts in understanding the molecular mechanisms driving lung adenocarcinoma and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. By integrating clinical variables with genomic data, this resource enables a multidimensional approach to investigating one of the most common and lethal cancer subtypes.


## Data Pre Processing

In this stage, we preprocess the dataset to ensure its quality for differential expression and enrichment analysis. First, we separate the gene expression data from the metadata, structuring the dataset for efficient analysis. Then, we apply filtering techniques to remove noise, retaining only biologically relevant information that will enhance the accuracy of downstream analyses.


```{r}
# Extract gene expression matrix
expression_data <- as.data.frame(assay(rna_seq_LUAD))

# Extract clinical metadata
clinical_data <- colData(rna_seq_LUAD)

# Check the first few rows of each dataset
head(expression_data)[,1:5]  
head(clinical_data)

```

###Initial Data Exploration

```{r}
# Filter genes with low expression
keep_genes <- rowSums(expression_data > 1) > ncol(expression_data) * 0.5
expression_filtered <- expression_data[keep_genes, ]

cat("Dimensions:", dim(rna_seq_LUAD)[1], "genes x", dim(rna_seq_LUAD)[2], "samples\n")

# Summaries
summary(expression_filtered[1:5, 1:5])  
summary(clinical_data)

cat("Genes:", nrow(expression_filtered), "\n")
cat("Samples:", ncol(expression_filtered), "\n")

# Gene-wise statistics
gene_stats <- data.frame(
  Mean = rowMeans(expression_filtered),
  SD = apply(expression_filtered, 1, sd)
)
summary(gene_stats)
```

#### Gene and Sample Metadata

```{r}
gene_metadata <- rowData(rna_seq_LUAD)
sample_metadata <- colData(rna_seq_LUAD)
cat("Gene metadata:", dim(gene_metadata), "\n")
cat("Sample metadata:", dim(sample_metadata), "\n")
```

### Missing Values (NA)

We analyze missing values in the dataset to identify patterns, assess their impact, and determine the best approach for handling them, ensuring data integrity for further analysis.

```{r}
# For expression_data (gene expression matrix)
percent_missing_expression = colSums(is.na(expression_data)) / nrow(expression_data) * 100

# For clinical_data (clinical_data)
percent_missing_clinical = colSums(is.na(clinical_data)) / nrow(clinical_data) * 100

unique(percent_missing_expression) #Output tem que ser melhor.
percent_missing_clinical
```
There were no NAs for the `gene expression matrix`. In the `clinical_data` some values are missing (NA). We need to remove or impute these values to avoid bias.

```{r}
columns_with_na = names(clinical_data)[colSums(is.na(clinical_data)) > 0]

# Variables with NAs
print(columns_with_na)

```

A table was created listing the variables and their corresponding missing values (NAs) to help identify which variables were selected for this analysis.

```{r}
tabela_nas = data.frame(Variável = names(clinical_data), 
                         Total_NAs = colSums(is.na(clinical_data)))

print(tabela_nas)
```

As a general rule in data preprocessing, variables with a high proportion of missing values can introduce bias or reduce the power of statistical analyses. Therefore, we chose to exclude variables with more than 30% missing values. This threshold strikes a balance between preserving as much data as possible while ensuring that the retained variables are informative and complete enough for meaningful analysis.
By applying this filter, we focused the dataset on the most relevant and reliable features, which will improve the robustness of the downstream statistical and bioinformatic analyses.


```{r}
# Set the NA threshold
threshold = 30  # in percent

# For clinical data
clinical_data_filtered = clinical_data[, percent_missing_clinical <= threshold]

columns_with_no_na <- names(clinical_data_filtered)[colSums(is.na(clinical_data_filtered)) == 0]

columns_with_no_na
```
After filtering the variables, we selected the following as our feature variables:
  `gender` : Biological sex of the patient (Male or Female --> Categorical Variable). Can influence disease prevalence and progression.
  
```{r}
## GENDER

barplot(table(clinical_data_filtered@listData[["gender"]]), 
        main = "Distribution of Gender", 
        xlab = "Gender", 
        ylab = "Count", 
        col = c("pink", "slategray1")[match(names(table(clinical_data_filtered@listData[["gender"]])), c("female", "male"))],
          border = "white")

```
  
  `race`: Self-reported racial background of the patient (Asian, American indian or Alaska native, Black or African American, White, Not Reported, Unknown --> Categorical Variable). May reflect epidemiological or socio-demographic patterns.
```{r}
## RACE

race_data <- clinical_data_filtered@listData[["race"]]
race_table <- table(race_data)


race_percent <- prop.table(race_table) * 100

race_df <- data.frame(
  Race = names(race_table),
  Count = as.vector(race_table),
  Percentage = round(as.vector(race_percent), 1)
)

print(race_df)



```
  Since the majority of patients are White (77.7%) or Black/African American (9.8%), and all other racial groups represent less than 2% each, we chose to focus our analysis on these two groups to ensure statistical relevance and interpretability.
  
```{r}
# Keep only rows where race is white or black or african american
clinical_data_filtered <- clinical_data_filtered[
  clinical_data_filtered@listData[["race"]] %in% c("white", "black or african american"),]
```

```{r}
barplot(table(clinical_data_filtered@listData[["race"]]),
        main = "Distribution of Race",
        xlab = "Race",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = c("lightseagreen", "salmon"),
          border = "white")
```
  `age_at_diagnosis`: Age of the patient at the time of initial diagnosis (In days --> Numerical Variable).
```{r}

clinical_data_filtered$age_at_diagnosis <- clinical_data_filtered$age_at_diagnosis / 365.25

hist(clinical_data_filtered$age_at_diagnosis,
     main = "Age at Diagnosis Distribution",
     xlab = "Age",
     col = "snow3",
     breaks = 30,
       border = "white")  # adjust for bin size

```
  `primary_diagnosis`: Main clinical diagnosis assigned to the patient (Type of tumor --> Categorical Variable). Will help us understand if the type of the tumor will have influence in our response variable.

```{r}
diagnosis_data <- clinical_data_filtered@listData[["primary_diagnosis"]]
diagnosis_table <- table(diagnosis_data)
diagnosis_percent <- prop.table(diagnosis_table) * 100
diagnosis_percent
```
Since the majority of cases are concentrated in Adenocarcinoma, NOS (56.19%) and Adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes (14.48%), and the other tumor types each represent less than 1%, with the 'Not Reported' category also being excluded, we will focus our analysis on these two tumor types to ensure statistical relevance and improve the interpretability of the results.
```{r}
# Keep only diagnoses with > 1% frequency
clinical_data_filtered <- clinical_data_filtered[
  clinical_data_filtered$primary_diagnosis %in% names(diagnosis_percent[diagnosis_percent > 1]), ]

# Remove "Not Reported"
clinical_data_filtered <- clinical_data_filtered[
  clinical_data_filtered$primary_diagnosis != "Not Reported", ]

table(clinical_data_filtered$primary_diagnosis)
```


```{r}

# Set colors (1 per type)

colors <- c("#6A0572", "#9D0191", "#FF6464", "#FFAB73", "#FFC93C", "#F9F871")


# Plot
# Example of a pie chart
pie(
  table(clinical_data_filtered$primary_diagnosis),
  main = "Primary Diagnosis",
  col = colors,
  border = "white"
)

```
  `adjj_pathologic_stage`: Represents the overall tumor stage (e.g., Stage I, II, III, IV) based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) system. This is a categorical clinical variable that reflects cancer progression and prognosis. It is highly relevant for survival analysis and differential expression studies, as advanced stages are typically associated with worse outcomes. Sub-stages denoted by letters such as A and B (e.g., IA vs IB) provide a finer classification within each stage, where A generally indicates a less advanced condition than B, often based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, or local invasion.
  
```{r}
ggplot(clinical_data_filtered, aes(x = ajcc_pathologic_stage)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of AJCC Pathologic Stages",
    x = "AJCC Pathologic Stage",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
The bar plot shows the distribution of AJCC pathologic stages among patients in the dataset. The most common stages are Stage IA and Stage IB, which together represent the majority of cases. Higher stages such as Stage IIIA, IIIB, and IV are progressively less frequent, as expected in a cohort with a range of disease severities.

A small number of patients are labeled as simply "Stage I" without further sub-classification (e.g., IA or IB), and a notable number of samples have missing values (NA). To ensure consistency and analytical accuracy, these samples will be excluded from subsequent analyses.
  
  `tissue_type`: Indicates the type of sample (Tumor, Normal --> Categorical Variable). Useful for distinguishing between diseased and control samples.
  
```{r}
barplot(table(clinical_data_filtered$tissue_type),
        main = "Distribution of Tissue Type",
        xlab = "Tissue Type",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = c("forestgreen", "darkred"),
          border = "white")
```
  
The response variable chosen is: `vital_status`. Indicates whether the patient is Alive or Dead at follow-up (Categorical Variable). It has a binary classification target. For us it will be useful for survival outcome prediction.

```{r}
barplot(table(clinical_data_filtered$vital_status),
        main = "Distribution of Vital Status",
        xlab = "Vital Status",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = c("plum", "plum4"),
          border = "white")

```


To ensure the reliability of downstream analyses, genes with low expression across the majority of samples were filtered out. Specifically, only genes with counts greater than 1 in more than 50% of the samples were retained. This step helps reduce noise from lowly expressed or non-informative genes.

```{r}
# Keep only genes where at least 50% of samples have counts >1
keep = rowSums(expression_data > 1) > (0.5 * ncol(expression_data))
filtered_data = expression_data[keep, ]

```

### Testes de Hipóteses

As part of the exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing was conducted to evaluate potential associations between key clinical variables and patient outcomes. These tests aim to identify statistically significant differences between groups, guiding further investigation in downstream analyses. In this study, we focused on the variables vital status, gender, race, age at diagnosis, primary diagnosis, and AJCC pathologic stage. These variables were selected due to their biological relevance and potential impact on lung adenocarcinoma progression and prognosis.

**Note**: for all statistical tests performed below, a significance level of 0.05 was considered.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Convert to base R data frame
clinical_df <- as.data.frame(clinical_data_filtered)

clinical_df <- clinical_df %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(age_at_diagnosis),
    !is.na(primary_diagnosis),
    !is.na(race),
    !is.na(gender),
    !is.na(vital_status),
    !is.na(ajcc_pathologic_stage),
    ajcc_pathologic_stage != "Stage I"
  )

# Reverse the order of levels
clinical_df$vital_status <- factor(clinical_df$vital_status, levels = c("Dead", "Alive"))

# Calculate proportion of "Dead" per diagnosis
dead_prop <- clinical_df %>%
  group_by(primary_diagnosis) %>%
  summarize(prop_dead = mean(vital_status == "Dead", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_dead))

# Reorder factor levels based on proportion
clinical_df$primary_diagnosis <- factor(clinical_df$primary_diagnosis,
                                        levels = dead_prop$primary_diagnosis)
```

### Vital Status by Primary Diagnosis

To explore potential differences in patient outcomes across histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, we examined the distribution of vital status (Alive vs Dead) by primary diagnosis. The bar plot below displays the proportion of survival outcomes within each diagnosis group, highlighting subtype-specific survival patterns.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plot
ggplot(clinical_df, aes(x = primary_diagnosis, fill = vital_status)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = after_stat(count)), 
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Vital Status by Primary Diagnosis", y = "Proportion") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```
Among the subtypes, Adenocarcinoma (NOS) and Adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes were the most represented. Notably, Adenocarcinoma, NOS showed a relatively higher proportion of deceased patients compared to some of the rarer subtypes, such as Acinar cell carcinoma and Mucinous adenocarcinoma, where survival rates appear higher.

However, the smaller sample sizes in certain groups (e.g., Mucinous and Papillary adenocarcinoma) limit the strength of direct comparisons. This variation underscores the importance of histological subtype in patient prognosis and suggests possible biological differences between subtypes.

A Chi-squared test was conducted to statistically evaluate the association between primary diagnosis and vital status. Although some subtypes show trends toward different outcomes, the test result (p = …) will help determine whether these observed differences are statistically significant.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(clinical_df$vital_status, clinical_df$primary_diagnosis))

```

The Chi-squared test is not reliable in this case, likely due to low expected counts in some cells. To address this limitation, we applied Fisher’s Exact Test with Monte Carlo simulation, which is more appropriate for contingency tables with small sample sizes or sparse data.
 
```{r}
fisher.test(table(clinical_df$vital_status, clinical_df$primary_diagnosis), simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```

Although there are visible differences in survival proportions across the primary diagnosis groups, the statistical tests did not find a significant association between vital status and primary diagnosis (p > 0.05 in both tests). This suggests that, within this dataset, histological subtype is not significantly associated with overall survival outcome — though sample size limitations, especially in rarer subtypes, may affect statistical power.

### Vital Status by Gender

To investigate potential sex-based differences in patient outcomes, we analyzed the distribution of vital status (Alive vs Dead) across gender. The bar plot below displays the proportion of survival outcomes within each gender group, allowing for visual comparison of mortality rates between males and females. Understanding gender-related survival patterns can provide insights into biological differences, healthcare access disparities, or treatment responses that may influence prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.

```{r}
# Plot
ggplot(clinical_df, aes(x = gender, fill = vital_status)) +
geom_bar(position = "fill") +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
labs(title = "Vital Status by Gender", y = "Proportion") +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
The plot illustrates the proportion of patients who are alive or deceased within each gender group. Among females, 142 are alive and 65 are deceased, while among males, 94 are alive and 59 are deceased. Although the absolute number of female patients is higher, the proportional survival appears similar between genders.

No obvious survival advantage is visually evident for either gender in this sample. To determine whether these observed differences are statistically meaningful, a formal hypothesis test is required.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(clinical_df$vital_status, clinical_df$gender))

```
Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no statistically significant association between gender and vital status in this dataset.

This confirms the visual impression from the bar plot: although there are slight numerical differences, the proportions of alive and deceased patients are statistically similar between males and females.

### Vital Status by Race

To explore whether patient survival varies by racial background, we examined the distribution of vital status (Alive vs Dead) across different race categories. This allows for the identification of potential disparities in outcomes, which may reflect biological, environmental, or healthcare access differences.

The bar plot (not shown here) displays the proportion of survival outcomes within each racial group. While the proportions may vary slightly between groups, visual inspection alone is insufficient to confirm any meaningful pattern.

```{r}
# Plot
ggplot(clinical_df, aes(x = race, fill = vital_status)) +
geom_bar(position = "fill") +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
labs(title = "Vital Status by Race", y = "Proportion") +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
The bar plot displays the distribution of vital status (Alive vs Dead) across two racial groups: Black or African American and White. Among Black or African American patients, 33 were alive and 9 were deceased. In contrast, among White patients, 203 were alive and 115 were deceased.

Although the raw numbers differ due to sample size imbalance, the proportions of survival outcomes appear somewhat different between the groups when examined visually.

To formally assess whether these differences are statistically significant, a Chi-squared test should be applied. If the resulting p-value is greater than 0.05, we would conclude that there is no significant association between race and vital status in this dataset.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(clinical_df$vital_status, clinical_df$race))
```
Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no statistically significant association between race and vital status in this dataset. However, the p-value is close to the significance threshold, suggesting a possible trend that may warrant further investigation in larger or more balanced samples.

### Vital Status by AJCC Pathologic Stage

To investigate the relationship between cancer severity and patient outcomes, we analyzed the distribution of vital status (Alive vs Dead) across different AJCC pathologic stages. As cancer stage is a key prognostic indicator, we expect higher stages to be associated with poorer survival.

```{r}
# Plot
ggplot(clinical_df, aes(x = ajcc_pathologic_stage, fill = vital_status)) +
geom_bar(position = "fill") +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
labs(title = "Vital Status by AJCC Pathologic Stage", y = "Proportion") +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
A clear trend emerges: earlier stages, such as Stage IA, show a higher proportion of patients alive (94 Alive vs 12 Dead), whereas advanced stages like Stage IIIB and Stage IV show a much higher proportion of deceased patients. For example, in Stage IIIB, only 6 patients are alive compared to 11 deceased — illustrating the sharp decline in survival as stage increases.

To statistically assess this relationship, both a Chi-squared test and Fisher’s Exact Test were applied:


```{r}
chisq.test(table(clinical_df$vital_status, clinical_df$ajcc_pathologic_stage))
```
```{r}
fisher.test(table(clinical_df$vital_status, clinical_df$ajcc_pathologic_stage), simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```
Both tests strongly reject the null hypothesis of independence (p < 0.001), confirming a significant association between AJCC pathologic stage and survival outcome. These results are consistent with clinical expectations: more advanced tumor stages are associated with significantly worse prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.

### Vital Status by Age at Diagnosis

To explore whether age at diagnosis influences patient survival, we compared the age distributions between patients who were alive and those who were deceased at the time of data collection. A boxplot was used to visualize potential differences in age between the two vital status groups.

```{r}
ggplot(clinical_df, aes(x = vital_status, y = age_at_diagnosis , fill = vital_status)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 21, outlier.fill = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Age at Diagnosis by Vital Status",
    x = "Vital Status",
    y = "Age at Diagnosis (years)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")  # optional: remove redundant legend

```
This visual trend suggests a possible relationship between age and survival, where older age at diagnosis may be linked to worse outcomes. However, the overlapping interquartile ranges also indicate that the difference may not be substantial.

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk test for normality in each group
shapiro.test(clinical_df$age_at_diagnosis[clinical_df$vital_status == "Alive"])
shapiro.test(clinical_df$age_at_diagnosis[clinical_df$vital_status == "Dead"])
```
The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the age distributions for both the alive and deceased groups significantly deviate from a normal distribution (p < 0.05). To visually confirm this outcome, we generated Q-Q plots for each group, which further supported the presence of deviations from normality.

```{r}
qqnorm(clinical_df$age_at_diagnosis[clinical_df$vital_status == "Alive"])
qqline(clinical_df$age_at_diagnosis[clinical_df$vital_status == "Alive"])
```
```{r}
qqnorm(clinical_df$age_at_diagnosis[clinical_df$vital_status == "Dead"])
qqline(clinical_df$age_at_diagnosis[clinical_df$vital_status == "Dead"])
```
The plots show noticeable deviations from the diagonal line, particularly in the tails, further supporting the conclusion that the data are not normally distributed. Given the violation of normality assumptions, we proceeded with a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the age distributions between groups.

```{r}
wilcox.test(age_at_diagnosis ~ vital_status, data = clinical_df)
```
Since the p-value is much greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no statistically significant difference in age at diagnosis between patients who are alive and those who are deceased in this cohort.

## Differential expression and enrichment analysis

### Differential expression analysis
#### DESEQ2

In order to analyze the genes that are differentially expressed in the tumor type **“Adenocarcinoma, NOS”** within **Lung Adenocarcinoma** (TCGA, GDC), based on the patients’ vital status, a data pre-processing step was performed to facilitate and optimize the differential expression analysis while reducing computational time and resource usage.


```{r}
clinical_df
```

Initially, samples with the primary diagnosis **“Adenocarcinoma, NOS”** were filtered, as only these samples are relevant to our study due to the higher incidence of this cancer subtype. 


```{r}
diagnosis_table

filtered_diagnosis = clinical_df[clinical_df == "Adenocarcinoma, NOS"]
data_ADC = expression_data[,rownames((filtered_diagnosis))]
dim(data_ADC)
```

```{r}
metadata_col = SummarizedExperiment::colData(rna_seq_LUAD)
geneExp = SummarizedExperiment::assay(rna_seq_LUAD, "unstranded")

filtered_data = metadata_col[!is.na(metadata_col$primary_diagnosis),]
filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data$primary_diagnosis=="Adenocarcinoma, NOS",]

ADC_data = geneExp[,rownames(filtered_data)]
dim(ADC_data)

```
After subsetting the dataset to include only samples with a primary diagnosis of "Adenocarcinoma, NOS", the gene expression matrix (ADC_data) contained **60,660 genes**. Since there were no missing values in the expression data, all annotated genes were initially retained. However, many of these genes either showed no expression or had consistently low expression across the samples, which can introduce noise in downstream analyses. To address this, an additional filtering step was applied to remove genes with zero counts across all samples, as well as those with fewer than 20 counts in fewer than 4 samples. These filtering criteria follow standard guidelines from the DESeq2 workflow, ensuring that only genes with sufficient expression are retained for meaningful differential expression analysis.


Next, we checked for missing values in the **vital status** column. 

```{r}
sum(is.na(filtered_data$vital_status))
filtered_data$vital_status = factor(filtered_data$vital_status)
```
Since no missing values were found, the “vital_status” metadata was converted into a factor, as the differential expression analysis using the **DESeq2** package recommends using factors instead of character variables.

After the preprocessing steps, the final dataset included approximately **33,293 genes** and **323 samples**. With this filtered dataset, we created the **DESeqDataSet** object, using the “vital_status” factor as the explanatory variable in the model.
This analysis used a significance threshold of α = 0.05 to identify genes differentially expressed between vital status groups.

```{r}
ddsSE = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = ADC_data, colData = filtered_data, design = ~vital_status)


# filtragem de genes com menos de 20 ocorrências em pelo menos 4 amostras
keep_genes = rowSums(counts(ddsSE) >= 20) >= 4
ddsSE = ddsSE[keep_genes, ]
dim(ddsSE)

```
After the preprocessing steps, the final dataset included approximately **33,293 genes** and **323 samples**. With this filtered dataset, we created the **DESeqDataSet** object, using the “vital_status” factor as the explanatory variable in the model.

```{r}
ddsSE_norm = DESeq(ddsSE)
res = results(ddsSE_norm, alpha = 0.05)

summary(res) # summary of differential expression test results
```


```{r}
sum(res$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE) # Total number of genes with differential expression
```

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 on a dataset comprising **33,293 genes** with non-zero read counts across 323 samples. 

```{r}
de_gene_count <- sum(res$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
print(de_gene_count)
```

Following model fitting and hypothesis testing, a total of 5,994 genes were found to be differentially expressed with an adjusted p-value below 0.05. 

This analysis highlights a considerable shift in gene expression, particularly toward downregulation, which may reflect underlying biological processes or responses in the studied conditions.

```{r}
# Total number of tested genes
total_genes <- sum(!is.na(res$padj))

# Number of significantly differentially expressed genes (padj < 0.05)
sig_genes <- sum(res$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)

# Percentage of DE genes
percent_DE <- round((sig_genes / total_genes) * 100, 2)

# Among DE genes, count upregulated and downregulated
upregulated <- sum(res$padj < 0.05 & res$log2FoldChange > 0, na.rm = TRUE)
downregulated <- sum(res$padj < 0.05 & res$log2FoldChange < 0, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print results
cat("Total tested genes:", total_genes, "\n")
cat("Significantly DE genes:", sig_genes, "(", percent_DE, "% )\n")
cat("Upregulated:", upregulated, "\n")
cat("Downregulated:", downregulated, "\n")

```

```{r}
#  graphical display of results
DESeq2::plotMA(res, main="DESeq2 differential expression analysis")
```

Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 identified **5,994 genes** (approximately 18% of the 33,293 tested) as significantly differentially expressed between the "Alive" and "Dead" groups, based on an adjusted p-value (padj) threshold of < 0.05. Of these, **1,496 genes** were significantly upregulated, while **4,498 genes** were downregulated, indicating a strong bias toward decreased expression. This trend was further supported by the MA plot, which revealed a higher density of significantly downregulated genes with negative log2 fold changes. These findings suggest notable shifts in gene expression, potentially reflecting underlying biological mechanisms or regulatory changes associated with the studied condition.


```{r}
plotCounts(ddsSE_norm, gene=which.min(res$padj), intgroup="vital_status", pch = 19)
plotCounts(ddsSE_norm, gene=which.min(res$padj), intgroup="vital_status", pch = 19)

resOrdered = res[order(res$padj),]
resOrdered[1,]
```

**ENSG00000202538.1** showed high expression in both groups but with reduced variability among "Dead" samples, possibly indicating more uniform gene regulation in that condition.

Together, these observations support the global trend identified in the analysis and highlight genes that may be biologically relevant in the context of survival.

### edgeR

To mitigate biases introduced by differences in sequencing depth or library size, normalization of the raw count data was performed prior to downstream analyses such as differential expression testing. This step is critical to ensure meaningful biological comparisons between samples.
The `cpm()` function is used to normalize raw count data (ADC_data) by converting it into Counts Per Million (CPM). This method adjusts for differences in library sizes across samples, making the data comparable.

```{r}
# Normalization of count data
ADC_data_CPM = cpm(ADC_data)
dim(ADC_data_CPM)
```
The `cpm()` function from the edgeR package was used to convert raw counts in ADC_data into Counts Per Million (CPM). This normalization accounts for library size by scaling the raw counts relative to the total number of reads per sample, multiplied by one million. The resulting ADC_data_CPM matrix contains normalized expression values that are directly comparable across samples. The `dim()` function is then used to inspect the dimensions of the resulting CPM matrix, providing a quick check on the number of genes and samples retained after normalization.


To identify genes with meaningful levels of expression, a logical matrix min_exp is created. Each entry in this matrix evaluates whether a gene’s CPM value exceeds 0.5 in a given sample. 
The rowSums(min_exp) >= 2 condition ensures that only genes with a CPM value greater than 0.5 in at least two samples are retained for further analysis. This filter eliminates genes with minimal or no detectable expression across the dataset, which could otherwise introduce noise or bias into the analysis. The filtered dataset ADC_data_filtered thus contains only those genes deemed reliably expressed, enhancing the robustness and interpretability of subsequent steps.

```{r}
# Removal of genes that do not have an expression of 0.5 or higher in at least 2 samples 
min_exp = ADC_data_CPM > 0.5
keep_rows =  rowSums(min_exp) >= 2
ADC_data_CPM_filt = ADC_data_CPM[keep_rows,]
dim(ADC_data_CPM_filt)

```

```{r}
# Transformation of standardized counts
dgeObj = DGEList(ADC_data_CPM_filt)
log_geneExp_filt = cpm(dgeObj, log=TRUE)
boxplot(log_geneExp_filt[,1:100], xlab="", ylab="Log2 counts per million",las=2)
abline(h=median(log_geneExp_filt),col="deeppink")
title("Boxplots of logCPMs (not normalized)")
```

This boxplot confirms that there is variability in expression distributions across our samples, justifying normalization. It also supports our decision to apply a CPM > 0.5 filter in at least 2 samples, as many genes appear to hover near or below that threshold.


```{r}
# Normalization of the library size of each sample
dgeObj = calcNormFactors(dgeObj)

```
After creating the DGEList object dgeObj containing raw count data, normalization factors are calculated using the calcNormFactors() function from the edgeR package. This step accounts for compositional differences between libraries that are not due to sequencing depth alone—such as the presence of a few highly expressed genes in some samples. The method scales the raw counts so that expression levels are comparable across samples, ensuring that observed differences reflect biological variation rather than technical artifacts.

To perform a differential expression analysis, a design matrix is constructed to specify the experimental conditions. 
```{r}
# Differential expression analysis
vital_status = as.factor(filtered_data$vital_status)
design = model.matrix(~vital_status)
```
Here, vital_status ("Alive" vs. "Dead") is extracted from the metadata and converted into a factor to indicate categorical grouping. The model.matrix() function then builds a design matrix based on this grouping, where the intercept represents one condition (the baseline), and the second column represents the contrast of interest. 


```{r}
# To estimate common dispersion, trend dispersion and tag dispersion in a single run
dgeObj = estimateDisp(dgeObj, design = design)

fit = glmFit(dgeObj, design)

lrt = glmLRT(fit, coef=2)
topTags(lrt)
```

`estimateDisp()` estimates three types of dispersion in one step:

    Common dispersion: overall variability across genes.
    Trend dispersion: dependence of dispersion on gene abundance.
    Tagwise dispersion: gene-specific dispersion values.
    
`glmFit()` fits a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) to the count data using the provided design matrix. This model incorporates the estimated dispersions and allows for group-wise comparisons.
`glmLRT()` performs a likelihood ratio test for differential expression. The coef = 2 argument specifies that the second column of the design matrix is the coefficient being tested.
`topTags(lrt)` returns a ranked table of genes based on statistical significance, with adjusted p-values (FDR) and log-fold changes, highlighting the most differentially expressed genes between the two groups.


```{r}
#Genes information (underexpressed (down), not significant(NotSig), overexpressed(Up))

summary(decideTests(lrt))
```

```{r}
# Graphic visualization of differentially expressed genes
plotMD(lrt)
abline(h=c(-1, 1), col="burlywood2")
```

 There is a much larger cluster of blue points below zero, indicating a strong downregulation trend in the "Dead" group. This aligns with our earlier stat showing 4,498 downregulated genes, compared to only 1,496 upregulated.
    The density of black points near the logFC = 0 line shows that the majority of genes are not differentially expressed, which is typical in RNA-seq datasets.
    The horizontal brown lines indicate a fold-change threshold. Genes beyond these lines have substantial expression shifts.

This plot supports the earlier conclusion that the "Dead" group shows a global downregulation pattern compared to the "Alive" group. This could suggest transcriptional repression or loss of cellular function associated with death or disease severity.

```{r}
# glmTreat is used to filter the DE genes and focus only on the genes that are most biologically significant
# filter out the differentially expressed genes with the greatest biological importance

filtered_results = glmTreat(fit, lfc=log2(1.5))
topTags(filtered_results)


summary(decideTests(filtered_results))
plotMD(filtered_results)
abline(h=c(-1, 1), col="burlywood2")
```

This version appears to show fewer significantly regulated genes, as seen by the smaller number of red and blue dots.
    Most points remain concentrated around the zero log-fold-change line, implying that most genes are not significantly different between the Alive and Dead groups.
    The few upregulated genes (red) cluster on the left side (lower expression), suggesting that significant changes may be occurring in lowly expressed genes.
    The downregulated genes (blue) also appear mostly in low-expression regions.
While the trend of downregulation in the "Dead" group still exists, the number of differentially expressed genes is lower, suggesting that after stricter filtering the DE genes and focus only on the genes that are most biologically significant, only the most robust changes are retained.

### Enrichment analysis

The goal of this section is to identify genes whose expression levels differ significantly between the two clinical conditions ("Alive" vs. "Dead") and prepare the results for downstream enrichment analysis. We use a generalized linear model (GLM) approach implemented in the edgeR package to perform this task.

```{r}
vital_status = as.factor(filtered_data$vital_status)
design = model.matrix(~vital_status)

dgeObj = estimateDisp(dgeObj, design = design)


fit = glmFit(dgeObj, design)

lrt = glmLRT(fit, coef=2)
topTags(lrt)

```

    Genes like ENSG00000122585.8 (logFC = 5.7) are highly upregulated in deceased patients — may be linked to disease progression.
    Genes like ENSG00000138379.5 (logFC = -4.57) are strongly downregulated — could indicate suppressed pathways or protective mechanisms in survivors.

```{r}
# Genes information (under-expressed, not significant, over-expressed)
summary(decideTests(lrt))
```

```{r}
# Graphic visualization of differentially expressed genes
plotMD(lrt)
abline(h=c(-1, 1), col="lightpink4")
```

There is a strong downregulation trend in the "dead" group.

    A smaller number of genes are significantly upregulated.
    Most genes are not significantly differentially expressed (black dots).
    The MD plot helps quickly visualize this differential expression landscape.

```{r}
# glmTreat é usado para filtrar os genes DE e focar apenas nos genes que são mais biologicamente significativos
# filtrar os genes diferencialmente expressos com maior importância biológica
filtered_results = glmTreat(fit, lfc=log2(1.5))
topTags(filtered_results)


summary(decideTests(filtered_results))
plotMD(filtered_results)
abline(h=c(-1, 1), col="lightpink4")
```

1,496 genes are significantly upregulated in "Dead".
4,498 genes are significantly downregulated in "Dead".
This still reflects a dominance of downregulation, which may suggest biological suppression or loss of function pathways in individuals with this outcome.

    Most genes are not differentially expressed (black).
    There's a strong downregulation trend in the "Dead" group.
    This type of plot is crucial in identifying candidate genes for deeper biological or clinical interpretation (e.g., biomarker discovery, pathway enrichment).

Next, the Ensembl IDs of the genes identified in the study were collected and analyzed to determine whether they exhibit differential expression under the conditions being studied.
The analysis performed using the edgeR package revealed that none of the genes mentioned in the study show differential expression with respect to the “vital_status” variable

filtered_res <- filtered_res[filtered_res$padj < 0.05, ]
filtered_res
```

All 4 genes show statistically significant differential expression (padj < 0.01).

    3 of them (ENSG00000122711.9, ENSG00000185269.12, ENSG00000145692.15) are downregulated in individuals who are deceased.
    1 gene (ENSG00000130055.14) is upregulated, though with a moderate fold change.
